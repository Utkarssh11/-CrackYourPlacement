Hi everyone!

I am excited to share that I have started the **#CrackYourInternship** and **#CrackYourPlacement** Challenge by Arsh Goyal Sir! This challenge is a fantastic way to dive deep into DSA and prepare thoroughly for internships and placements.


As a student preparing for technical interviews and working through Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA), I created this repository to help myself and others.  I hope it will be just as beneficial for you....

This repository includes or covering a wide range of DSA topics. The questions are organized into categories such as arrays, linked lists, trees, graphs, dynamic programming, and more. Many of these questions are those that have been asked in recent interviews at major tech companies.

**Hereâ€™s how I use this sheet:**

I solve one question each day to maintain consistency in my preparation. This approach helps me deeply understand each concept and improve my problem-solving skills. Each file in this repository contains a problem statement and its solution. By tackling these questions daily, I ensure steady progress and keep my skills sharp.

## Getting Started
